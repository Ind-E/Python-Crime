Data: FBI Crime data

### Research Questions:
- How do robbery rates vary by state?
- How are robbery rates related to the number of law enforcement employees?
- What are the most robbed locations by state?
- Is there any relationship between weapon used and month? (bad)

### Hypotheses:
- States with higher populations will have higher robbery rates
- Years where there are more law enforcement employees per 1000 people will have less robbery
- the most commonly robbed locations vary by state
- The average number of crimes committed by offenders under 30 years old is greater than the number of crimes committed by offenders 30 and older.
